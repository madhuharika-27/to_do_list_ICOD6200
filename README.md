Task Description:
This Task is assigned to Konga Madhu Harika during the CodTech IT Solutions internship program is to create a TO DO LIST web application using html,css and javascript.

Implementation and Code Explaination:

1. HTML Structure:
   - The HTML code defines the structure of the To Do List application. It includes a container div with Bootstrap classes to center the content.
   - Within the container, a row and column structure is used to organize the elements on the page.
   - The "h1" heading provides a clear title for the application, indicating that it's a To Do List.
   - An input field with the "taskname" id allows users to enter new tasks they want to add to the list.
   - The "ADD" button triggers the "addtolist" function when clicked, adding the task entered in the input field to the list.
   - The "mytodo" div serves as a container for displaying the list of tasks added by the user.

2. CSS Styling:
   - CSS is used to style the appearance of the To Do List application, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive design.
   - Various CSS properties are applied to elements such as background colors, fonts, borders, margins, and padding to enhance the overall look and feel of the application.
   - Bootstrap classes are utilized for responsiveness and layout consistency, ensuring that the application looks good on different screen sizes and devices.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - JavaScript provides the functionality for adding and deleting tasks in the To Do List.
   - The "addtolist" function is triggered when the user clicks the "ADD" button. It retrieves the value entered in the input field, creates a new list item element containing the task         name, and appends it to the task list.
   - Each task item includes a delete button (represented by the trash can icon) that, when clicked, triggers the "deleteitem" function. This function removes the corresponding task from       the list.
   - The "clr" function clears the input field after a task is added to the list, ensuring a smooth user experience for entering multiple tasks.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the To Do List application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript offers a user-friendly solution for managing tasks effectively. Through a well-structured HTML layout, visually appealing CSS styling, and interactive JavaScript functionality, users can easily add, view, and delete tasks with ease. The application's simplicity and intuitive design make it accessible to users of all levels, whether for personal task management or collaborative project tracking. By combining these technologies, the To Do List demonstrates the power of web development in creating practical tools that enhance productivity and organization. Overall, this project highlights the importance of a seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating functional and user-centric web applications.
